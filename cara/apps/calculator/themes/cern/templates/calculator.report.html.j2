  The results of this simulation are colour coded according to the risk values authorized at CERN (approved in December 2020):
  <ul><li>Events with a <span class="green_bkg">P(i) less than 5%</span> may go ahead without further mitigation measures.</li>
    <li>Events with a <span class="yellow_bkg">P(i) between 5% and 15%</span> shall be subject to ALARA principles (see footnote) to minimise the risk before proceeding.</li>
    <li>Events with a <span class="red_bkg">P(i) exceeding 15% or a number of expected new cases that exceeds 1</span> may not take place until additional measures are in place and a risk reduction has been performed.</li>

	    <strong> Footnotes for ALARA: </strong><br>
	    ALARA stands for As Low As Reasonably Achievable. It can be summarised based on 3 main points:
	    <ol>
	    	<li>Justification - any exposure of persons has to be justified </li>
	    	<li>Limitation - the personal doses have to be kept below the legal limits (in this case the CERN exposure limits)</li>
	    	<li>Optimisation - the personal doses and collective doses have to be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).</li>
	    </ol>
