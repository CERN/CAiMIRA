The CO₂ fitting algorithm represents a significant extension to the CAiMIRA model. The algorithm enhances the model by predicting equivalent **exhalation rates** and **ventilation profiles** based on measured indoor CO₂ concentrations. 

By leveraging these predictions, the algorithm reduces the reliance on user-estimated parameters which are often subject to large uncertainties and best-guess estimates, providing more accurate results.
