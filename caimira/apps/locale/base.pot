"We wish to thank CERN’s HSE Unit, Beams Department, Experimental Physics "
"Department, Information Technology Department, Industry, Procurement and "
"Knowledge Transfer Department and International Relations Sector for "
"their support to the study. Thanks to Doris Forkel-Wirth, Benoit Delille,"
" Walid Fadel, Olga Beltramello, Letizia Di Giulio, Evelyne Dho, Wayne "
"Salter, Benoit Salvant and colleagues from the COVID working group for "
"providing expert advice and extensively testing the model. Finally, we "
"wish to thank Fabienne Landua and the design service for preparing the "
"illustrations and Alessandro Raimondo and Manuela Cirilli from the "
"Knowledge Transfer Group for their continuous support. Our compliments "
"towards the work and research performed by world leading scientists in "
"this domain: Dr. Julian Tang, Prof. Manuel Gameiro, Dr. Linsey Marr, "
"Prof. Lidia Morawska, Prof. Yuguo Li, and others – their scientific "
"contribution was indispensable for this project. "

"CARA models the concentration profile of virions in enclosed spaces with "
"clear and intuitive graphs.\n"
"    The user can set a number of parameters, including room volume, "
"exposure time, activity type, mask-wearing and ventilation.\n"
"    The report generated indicates how to avoid exceeding critical "
"concentrations and chains of airborne transmission in spaces such as "
"individual offices, meeting rooms and labs."

"The risk assessment tool simulates the long-range airborne spread SARS-"
"CoV-2 virus in a finite volume, assuming a homogenous mixture, and "
"estimates the risk of COVID-19 airborne transmission therein.\n"
"    The results DO NOT include short-range airborne exposure (where the "
"physical distance is a significant factor) nor the other known modes of "
"SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n"
"    Hence, the output from this model is only valid when the other "
"recommended public health & safety instructions are observed, such as "
"adequate physical distancing, good hand hygiene and other barrier "
"measures."

"The model used is based on scientific publications relating to airborne "

"related risk mitigation measures."

"Note that this model applies a deterministic approach, i.e., it is "
"assumed at least one person is infected and shedding viruses into the "
"simulated volume.\n"
"    Nonetheless, it is also important to understand that the absolute "
"risk of infection is uncertain, as it will depend on the probability that"
" someone infected attends the event.\n"
"    The model is most useful for comparing the impact and effectiveness "
"of different mitigation measures such as ventilation, filtration, "
"exposure time, physical activity and\n"
"    the size of the room, only considering long-range airborne "
"transmission of COVID-19 in indoor settings."

"This tool is designed to be informative, allowing the user to adapt "
"different settings and model the relative impact on the estimated "
"infection probabilities.\n"
"    The objective is to facilitate targeted decision-making and "
"investment through comparisons, rather than a singular determination of "
"absolute risk.\n"
"    While the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in circulation among the population, "
"the notion of 'zero risk' or 'completely safe scenario' does not exist.\n"
"    Each event modelled is unique, and the results generated therein are "
"only as accurate as the inputs and assumptions."
