<h3>{{_("Ventilation type")}}</h3>
<br>
<p>{{_("There are three main options:")}}</p>
<br>
<h4>{{_("Mechanical ventilation")}}</h4>
<br>
<p>{{_("If the room has mechanical ventilation, suppling fresh air from outside (either a local or centralised system), you should select this option.

<p>{{_("Please bear in mind that any of the two inputs only consider the supply of fresh air. If a portion of air is recirculated, it shall not be accounted for in the inputs.")}}</p>
<br>
<h4>{{_("Natural ventilation")}}</h4>
<br>

<p>{{_("When using natural ventilation, the circulation of air is simulated as a function of the difference between the temperature inside the room and the outside air temperature. The average outdoor temperature for each hour of the day has been computed for every month of the year based on historical data for Geneva, Switzerland.
It is therefore very important to enter the correct time and date in the event data section.
Finally, you must specify if the windows are open permanently (at all the times), or periodically (in intervals for a certain duration during the course of the day) - e.g. open the window for 10 minutes (duration) every 60 minutes (frequency).")}}</p>

It is possible to specify a different time for the entry and exit of both the exposed and infected person, however for most cases (where we do not know apriori which of the occupants is infected), it is recommended to set these to the same values as the activity start and end.")}}</p>

This will be useful if you plan to simulate a typical full working day.
During the lunch break it is assumed that all occupants will leave the simulated space (to go eat lunch somewhere else - restaurant or break room).
If you plan to eat lunch in the same area where you have been working, you should select 'No' even if a lunch break will be taken, since the risk of infection is related to the occupation of the simulated space.
See 'Split Breaks' if the occupants do not break at the same time.")}}</p>
<p>{{_("It should also be noted that the infection probabilities presented in the report does not take into account any potential exposures during the break times.")}}</p>

<h4>{{_("Coffee Breaks")}}</h4>

It is assumed that all occupants vacate the space during the break period.

<p>{{_("When enabled, the breaks are spread equally throughout the day - for example if we simulate the period from 9:00 to 18:00, with a lunch break from 13:00 to 14:00 and considering 2 coffee breaks, the tool will schedule the first coffee break around 11:00 and the second around 16:00.
The exact timing of the breaks within the day is not particularly critical to an accurate simulation, so you do not need to be concerned about major differences if you take a coffee break at 10:00 instead of 11:00.
The variation of coffee breaks can be altered in 5 minute increments up to 30 minutes in length.
Note that this doesn't necessarily have to be a coffee break, it can represent any period where the simulated space is vacated.
See 'Split Breaks' if the occupants do not break at the same time.")}}</p>
